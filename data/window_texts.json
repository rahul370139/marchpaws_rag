  "When a nonmedical Soldier encounters an unconscious or injured Soldier, he must quickly and accurately evaluate the situation and the casualty to determine if it is safe for him to act as well as what, if any, first aid measures may be needed to prevent further injury or death. He should ask if trained medical personnel are available or direct someone else at the scene to call for or locate trained medical personnel. To prevent further injury to the casualty, once first aid has begun to be administered there should be no interruptions and those efforts should continue until such time as that Soldier is relieved by medical personnel. Soldiers may also have to depend upon their own first aid knowledge and skills to save themselves (self-aid). A thorough understanding of the fundamentals of first aid can save a life, prevent permanent disability, or reduce long periods of hospitalization by knowing WHAT to do, WHAT NOT to do, and WHEN to do it.\n\nThe following key terms are identified and described in order to provide a further understanding of first aid. The key terms are presented in alphabetical order, not in order of importance.",
  "The following key terms are identified and described in order to provide a further understanding of first aid. The key terms are presented in alphabetical order, not in order of importance.\n\nKnowledge of a few key terms will help Soldiers to better understand and appreciate the role that they play when providing first aid in tactical and nontactical environments. These terms include\u2014 - Casualty evacuation (CASEVAC). - Combat lifesaver. - Combat medic. - Emergency medical treatment. - Enhanced first aid. - . - Medical evacuation. - Medical treatment. - Medical treatment facility. - Tactical combat casualty care.\n\nKnowing the key terms as they are used in Army doctrine assists in the understanding of when and how Soldiers provide first aid procedures in garrison or when deployed.\n\nNonmedical units use this to refer to the movement of casualties aboard nonmedical vehicles or aircraft without en route medical care.\n\nCombat lifesavers are nonmedical Soldiers selected by their unit commander for additional training beyond basic first aid procedures. Combat lifesavers provide enhanced first aid for injuries.\n\nCombat medics are the first individuals in the medical chain that make medically substantiated decisions based on medical MOS-specific training.\n\nEmergency medical treatment is the immediate application of medical procedures to the wounded, injured, or sick by specially trained medical personnel.\n\nEnhanced first aid is administered by the combat lifesaver. It includes measures, which require an additional level of training above self-aid and buddy aid.",
  "Emergency medical treatment is the immediate application of medical procedures to the wounded, injured, or sick by specially trained medical personnel.\n\nEnhanced first aid is administered by the combat lifesaver. It includes measures, which require an additional level of training above self-aid and buddy aid.\n\nUrgent and immediate lifesaving and other measures which can be performed for casualties (or performed by the casualty himself) by nonmedical personnel when medical personnel are not immediately available.\n\nMedical evacuation is the process of moving any person who is wounded, injured, or ill to and/or between medical treatment facilities while providing en route medical care. Also referred to as MEDEVAC in relation to the 9-line medical evacuation request.\n\nMedical treatment is the care and management of wounded, injured, or ill personnel by medically trained personnel.\n\nMedical treatment facility is any facility established for the purpose of providing medical treatment. This includes battalion aid stations, Role 2 facilities, dispensaries, clinics, and hospitals.\n\nTactical combat casualty care is often referred to as TC3. Tactical combat casualty care is prehospital care provided in a tactical-combat setting. Tactical combat casualty care is divided into the following three stages: - Care under fire. - Tactical field care. - Tactical evacuation.\n\nBasic understanding of vital body systems is crucial in the understanding and performance of first aid. Understanding vital body systems not only assists in first aid, but prevents doing any more harm to the casualty.",
  "Tactical combat casualty care is often referred to as TC3. Tactical combat casualty care is prehospital care provided in a tactical-combat setting. Tactical combat casualty care is divided into the following three stages: - Care under fire. - Tactical field care. - Tactical evacuation.\n\nBasic understanding of vital body systems is crucial in the understanding and performance of first aid. Understanding vital body systems not only assists in first aid, but prevents doing any more harm to the casualty.\n\nFor Soldiers to perform first aid effectively they must have a basic understanding of the structure and function of these vital body systems. These systems are the respiratory system, the circulatory system, and\n\nHuman beings require oxygen to live. Through the breathing process (respiration), the lungs draw oxygen from the air and transfer it to the red blood cells within the circulatory system.\n\nThe normal range of respirations varies based on the age and physical condition of the individual at rest. For example\u2014 - Adults 12 to 20 breaths per minute. - Children (1 to 10 years): 15 to 30 breaths per minute. - Infants (6 to 12 months): 25 to 50 breaths per minute. - Infants (0 to 5 months): 25 to 40 breaths per minute.\n\nThe respiratory system consists of the\u2014 - Airway. - Lungs. - Rib cage.\n\nThe airway consists of the nose, mouth, throat, voice box, and windpipe. It is the canal through which air passes to and from the lungs.",
  "The respiratory system consists of the\u2014 - Airway. - Lungs. - Rib cage.\n\nThe airway consists of the nose, mouth, throat, voice box, and windpipe. It is the canal through which air passes to and from the lungs.\n\nThe lungs are two elastic organs made up of thousands of tiny air sacs and covered by an airtight membrane.\n\nThe rib cage is formed by the muscle-connected ribs, which join the spine in back and the breastbone in front.\n\nThe circulatory system provides the vehicle for oxygen acquired through the respiratory process to be transported throughout the body.\n\nThe circulatory system consists of the\u2014 - Heart. - Blood. - Blood vessels (arteries, capillaries, and veins).\n\nSimply stated the heart is the engine that drives the human body. The only function of the heart is to pump blood. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs, where oxygen is added to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed from it. The left side pumps blood to the rest of the body, where oxygen and nutrients are delivered to tissues and waste products (such as carbon dioxide) are transferred to the blood for removal by other organs such as the lungs and kidneys.",

For example\u2014 - Adults 60 to 100 heartbeats per minute. - Children (1 to 6 years): 70 to 120 heartbeats per minute. - Infants (6 to 12 months): 80 to 140 heartbeats per minute. - Infants (0 to 5 months): 90 to 140 heartbeats per minute.\n\nThe heartbeat is a rhythmic cycle of contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle which causes expansion and contraction of the arteries as it forces blood through them. This cycle of expansion and contraction can be felt (monitored) at various points in the body and is called the pulse.",

This cycle of expansion and contraction can be felt (monitored) at various points in the body and is called the pulse.\n\nThe pulse is the first major indicator of the general physiological state of a casualty when Soldiers are performing a casualty assessment. The presence or absence will determine what needs to be done and the order in which those actions must be taken to preserve the life of the injured.\n\nThe points where a pulse can be readily felt are located at the following arterial points of the body: - Carotid. - Femoral. - Radial. - Posterior tibial.\n\nTo check the carotid pulse (carotid arteries, felt at the neck), feel for a pulse on the side of the casualty\u2019s neck closest to you. This is done by placing the tips of your first two fingers beside his Adam\u2019s apple.",

This is done by placing the tips of your first two fingers beside his Adam\u2019s apple.\n\nTo check the femoral pulse (large femoral artery located in the thigh [felt in the groin]), press the tips of your first two fingers into the middle of the groin.\n\nTo check the radial pulse (at the wrist), place your first two fingers on the thumb side of the casualty\u2019s wrist.\n\nTo check the posterior tibial pulse (inside the big toe side of the ankle), place your first two fingers on the inside of the ankle.\n\nIf the heart is the engine that drives the body, blood is the fuel which powers and sustains the human body. Blood is a mixture of plasma (liquid component), white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. The body contains about 5 to 6 quarts (about 5 liters) of blood. Once blood is pumped out of the heart, it takes 20 to 30 seconds to circulate through the body and return to the heart.",

Once blood is pumped out of the heart, it takes 20 to 30 seconds to circulate through the body and return to the heart.\n\nBlood performs essential functions as it circulates through the body. It delivers oxygen and essential nutrients (such as fats, sugars, minerals, and vitamins) to the body's tissues. It carries carbon dioxide to the lungs and other waste products to the kidneys for elimination from the body. Also, it carries components that fight infection and stop bleeding.\n\nBlood vessels are the conduit which transports blood pumped by the heart to the body. The blood vessels consist of\u2014 - Arteries. - Arterioles. - Capillaries. - Venules. - Veins.\n\nArteries are vessels that carry blood high in oxygen content away from the heart to the farthest reaches of the body. Arteries flow into arterioles.\n\nArterioles are small branches of arteries that lead to the capillaries.\n\nCapillaries are tiny blood vessels that connect arterioles (the smallest division of an artery) with venules.\n\nVenules are small veins that go from capillaries to veins.",
  "Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that connect arterioles (the smallest division of an artery) with venules.\n\nVenules are small veins that go from capillaries to veins.\n\nA blood vessel that carries blood that is low in oxygen content from the body back to the heart.\n\nThe skeleton provides a structural framework for the body and, because bones are rigid, provides support and protection for vital organs and softer tissues. Skeletal muscles and bones work together to make body movement possible.\n\nThe musculoskeletal system is composed of\u2014 - Bones. - Joints. - Muscles. - Cartilage. - Ligaments. - Tendons.\n\nBone is the substance that forms the skeleton of the body. It is composed chiefly of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. The human body has 206 bones. There are 80 axial (head and trunk) bones and 126 appendicular (upper and lower extremity) bones. Bones provide structural support for the body. Individual and groups of bones provide structure for the attachment of soft tissues and protect organs.\n\nJoints are the areas where two bones are attached for the purpose of permitting body parts to move.\n\nMuscle is the tissue of the body which primarily functions as a source of power. There are three types of muscle in the body. Muscle which is responsible for moving extremities and external areas of the body is called skeletal muscle. Heart muscle is called cardiac muscle. Muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel is called smooth muscle.",

Muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel is called smooth muscle.\n\nCartilage is a firm, rubbery tissue that cushions bones at joints. A flexible kind of cartilage makes up other parts of the body, such as the larynx and the outside parts of the ears.\n\nLigaments are a tough band of connective tissue that connects various structures, such as two bones.\n\nTendons are a soft tissue by which muscle attaches to bone. Tendons are somewhat flexible, but tough.\n\nProper conduct at the initial encounter of the casualty coupled with appropriate movement and transport is important in the successful provision of first aid. Appropriate decisions and first aid task execution helps to determine the health and wellbeing of the casualty.\n\nWhen a casualty is first encountered it is imperative that the responder quickly and accurately assess what has occurred, determine the nature and extent of injuries and what (if any) first aid measures are appropriate and necessary.",

  "A fracture is a break in the continuity of a bone. When properly cared for fractures generally heal without complication. However if severe enough and improperly cared for they can cause disability, loss of the limb or in some cases death by severing vital organs and/or arteries.\n\nThe potential for recovery depends greatly upon the first aid the individual receives before he is moved. First aid includes immobilizing the fractured part in addition to applying lifesaving measures when necessary. The basic splinting principle is to immobilize the joints above and below the fracture.\n\nThere are two kinds of fractures as follows: - Closed fracture\u2014is a broken bone that does not break the overlying skin.\n\nSigns and symptoms commonly associated with fractures include\u2014 - Deformity. - Tenderness. - Swelling. - Pain. - Inability to move the injured part. - Protruding bone. - Bleeding. - Discolored skin at the injury site.\n\nFirst aid for fractures involves immobilizing the affected area\n\nAfter the casualty\u2019s other more serious injuries have been assessed and treated, the casualty\u2019s suspected fracture of an arm or leg is treated. You will need a rigid or formable splint, four muslin bandages (cravats), three inch tape and a six inch elastic bandage, or field expedient materials in order to apply the rigid splint.\n\nThe splint must immobilize the suspected fracture so it does not move and circulation is not impaired. Take body substance isolation precautions (use the gloves in the IFAK). Prepare the casualty for the application of the splint.",
